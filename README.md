## Project: Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning!

Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

The purpose of a recommendation system is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalized lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence-based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.


#Types of Recommendation Systems:

1.Content-Based:
Definition: Utilizes item attributes and user profiles to make recommendations.
Examples: Twitter, YouTube.
Key Feature: Forms embeddings for item features, creating a vector for recommendation based on user-specific actions or similar items.

2.Collaborative-Based:
Definition: Relies on user-item interactions and clusters of users with similar preferences.
Examples: Book recommendations.
Key Feature: Considers only one parameter, such as ratings or comments, assuming that users with similar preferences will like the same items.
Issues:

Computationally expensive due to a user-item nXn matrix.
Tends to recommend only famous items.
New items might not receive recommendations.

3.Hybrid-Based:
Definition: Combines content-based and collaborative-based approaches to address individual system limitations.
Key Use: Utilizes techniques like word2vec and embedding for enhanced recommendation accuracy.
Advantages: Mitigates issues present in content-based and collaborative-based systems.
